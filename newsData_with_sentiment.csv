Ronaldo, who shares a history with both Amorim and the club, wished him success during a press interaction after Portugal's emphatic 5-1 victory over Poland in the Nations League. ""I wish him all the luck in the world. That’s what Manchester needs,"" said Ronaldo. His pointed remark underscored the enormity of the challenge Amorim faces at Old Trafford. In his first press conference as United manager, Amorim recently emphasized the importance of establishing a clear identity for the team. ""We know that we need time, but we have to win time. To win time is to win games,"" he explained. ""But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity. Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity,"" he added. The Portuguese manager also acknowledged his nickname, “The Poet,” given to him by Ronaldo. ""It’s something funny,"" he said, reflecting on his heartfelt communication style that resonates with players. Ronaldo’s association with United has been eventful. After rejoining the club in 2021, he delivered impressive individual performances but clashed with Ten Hag during the Dutchman’s tenure. His second stint ended controversially after an explosive interview criticizing the club and its management. Now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo remains a keen observer of United’s fortunes, especially with a compatriot at the helm. Amorim's tenure begins with a fixture against Ipswich on November 24. Reports suggest he is already eyeing reinforcements, with Sporting CP defender Goncalo Inacio a top target. United are prepared to compete with Real Madrid for Inacio’s signature, signaling the club’s commitment to backing their new manager.

His first steps will be scrutinized as he seeks to transform Manchester United into title contenders once more.
